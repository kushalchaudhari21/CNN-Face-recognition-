This project builds a deep learning architecture for CNN and performs face recognition using a mini face images dataset.

Files 00.py 01.py 02.py are for pre-processing. There is no need to run these files since we have already run them and got the X and Y representations of the data. 

For dataset or any queries you can contact me on linkedin with a message. 

File a.py runs all the models in it without minibatch and has instructions inside as comments. 
File b.py runs all the models in it with minibatch and has instructions inside as comments.
File c.py is an experimental file. We have added regularisation to cross entropy function to test with dropout as well as L2 regularisation. The results were not signification for this file so can be ignored.
